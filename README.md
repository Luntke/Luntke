Hey, I'm Merlin Luntke, also known as Luc or Lazy_Luc.

- Most of my projects are related to my website [jerma.org](https://jerma.org) (an unofficial website about the [Twitch streamer Jerma985](https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985)).
- I work mostly with web technologies for web browsers or Node.js.
- I'm not looking to collaborate on my personal projects.
- I don't publish most of my projects because they aren't that interesting or useful to others.
